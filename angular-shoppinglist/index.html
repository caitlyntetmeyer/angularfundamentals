			Angular is a framework that allows a developer to create Single Page Applications (SPAs).  This works because inside of index.html the ng-view directive has been added to the <main></main> html element.  Once the angular config file is built, new views can be injected into this portion of index.html.  They will also be affected by the css file built earlier.

			The ng-view directive works with ngRoute. Stuff will go here from views/home.html and views/shopping-list.html. 
			**Inject** HTML into DOM from other views we create. -->
